__All-in-One marketing platform for your e-commerce__

We know how difficult it is for you to handle marketing activities for your business and have great results. Our mission is to make e-commerce easy for you and your customers. 
With one easy-to-use app, you will be able to strengthen your marketing strategy and reach your goals in no time.

With [Retargeting Biz] (https://retargeting.biz/), online shops get 100% automated ads, up to 15% better Conversion Rate, up to 20% better Average Order Value (AOV) and time spent on the website, and up to 100% higher sales.
The key benefits for online stores that implement the Retargeting Bis solution are closely linked to marketing campaign automation and personalization, centralized marketing channel management, quickly and simply by means of a single platform, as well as resource optimization. 
On the one hand, human resources are enhanced because of the lesser time spent on setting up and managing marketing campaigns; less graphic design and content are needed.
